TreeTide Scheduler
------------------

Aim:

   A cooperative multi-process scheduler for Haxe/flash, making it easy to
      - run processes or tasks in parallel
      - apply Erlang-like message-passing

Usage:

   See the test examples. Not overcommented yet, but the Sched.hx source
   is quite explanatory.

   More and better examples to come.

   Message reception works best with hxpattern's gswitch()
